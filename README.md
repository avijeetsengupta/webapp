# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can check out hosted link in here [Web App Tv](https://webapp-tv.netlify.app/)

And I have used useHistory, data flow through props and callbacks functions. 

const parser = new DOMParser(); 

const doc = parser.parseFromString(data.summary, "text/html"); [This helps in Converting html language to string](#). 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
